                <h2>Villains</h2>
                <p>Marvel villains are almost as influential as their superheroes — for every Spider-Man and Reed Richards, there's a Green Goblin or a Doctor Doom. These antagonists are as important to pop culture as a whole as they are to Marvel Comics and the MCU.</p>
